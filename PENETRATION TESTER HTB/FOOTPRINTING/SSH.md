## Footprinting the Service

One of the tools we can use to fingerprint the SSH server is [ssh-audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit). It checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server. Of course, this could be exploited by attacking the server or client at the cryptic level later.

```

The first thing we can see in the first few lines of the output is the banner that reveals the version of the OpenSSH server. The previous versions had some vulnerabilities, such as [CVE-2020-14145](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-14145/), which allowed the attacker the capability to Man-In-The-Middle and attack the initial connection attempt. The detailed output of the connection setup with the OpenSSH server can also often provide important information, such as which authentication methods the server can use.

#### Change Authentication Method

  Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
```

For potential brute-force attacks, we can specify the authentication method with the SSH client option `PreferredAuthentications`.

  Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
debug1: Next authentication method: password

cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132's password:
```

Even with this obvious and secure service, we recommend setting up our own OpenSSH server on our VM, experimenting with it, and familiarizing ourselves with the different settings and options.

We may encounter various banners for the SSH server during our penetration tests. By default, the banners start with the version of the protocol that can be applied and then the version of the server itself. For example, with `SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1`, we know that we can use both protocol versions SSH-1 and SSH-2, and we are dealing with OpenSSH server version 3.9p1. On the other hand, for a banner with `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1`, we are dealing with an OpenSSH version 8.2p1 which only accepts the SSH-2 protocol version.

## Rsync

[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses port `873` and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.

This [guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials. If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.

Let's do a bit of quick footprinting. We can see that Rsync is in use using protocol 31.

#### Scanning for Rsync

  Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-19 09:31 EDT
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0058s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.13 seconds
```

#### Probing for Accessible Shares

We can next probe the service a bit to see what we can gain access to.

  Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list
dev            	Dev Tools
@RSYNCD: EXIT
```

#### Enumerating an Open Share

Here we can see a share called `dev`, and we can enumerate it further.

  Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev

receiving incremental file list
drwxr-xr-x             48 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:34:50 build.sh
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:36:02 secrets.yaml
drwx------             54 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .ssh

sent 25 bytes  received 221 bytes  492.00 bytes/sec
total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
```

From the above output, we can see a few interesting files that may be worth pulling down to investigate further. We can also see that a directory likely containing SSH keys is accessible. From here, we could sync all files to our attack host with the command `rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev`. If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the `-e ssh` flag, or `-e "ssh -p2222"` if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh) is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.

## R-Services

R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP. Initially developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (`CSRG`) at the University of California, Berkeley, `r-services` were the de facto standard for remote access between Unix operating systems until they were replaced by the Secure Shell (`SSH`) protocols and commands due to inherent security flaws built into them. Much like `telnet`, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (`MITM`) attacks.

`R-services` span across the ports `512`, `513`, and `514` and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as `r-commands`. They are most commonly used by commercial operating systems such as Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX. While less common nowadays, we do run into them from time to time during our internal penetration tests so it is worth understanding how to approach them.

The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

- rcp (`remote copy`)
- rexec (`remote execution`)
- rlogin (`remote login`)
- rsh (`remote shell`)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (`remote who`)

Each command has its intended functionality; however, we will only cover the most commonly abused `r-commands`. The table below will provide a quick overview of the most frequently abused commands, including the service daemon they interact with, over what port and transport method to which they can be accessed, and a brief description of each.

|**Command**|**Service Daemon**|**Port**|**Transport Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`rcp`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the `cp` command on Linux but provides `no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system`.|
|`rsh`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation.|
|`rexec`|`rexecd`|512|TCP|Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
|`rlogin`|`rlogind`|513|TCP|Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|

The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

#### /etc/hosts.equiv

  Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.equiv

# <hostname> <local username>
pwnbox cry0l1t3
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of `r-commands`, let's do some quick footprinting using `Nmap` to determine if all necessary ports are open.

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 10.0.17.2
