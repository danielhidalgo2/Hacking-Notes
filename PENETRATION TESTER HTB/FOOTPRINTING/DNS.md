The `SOA` record is located in a domain's zone file and specifies who is responsible for the operation of the domain and how DNS information for the domain is managed.

## Dangerous Settings

There are many ways in which a DNS server can be attacked. For example, a list of vulnerabilities targeting the BIND9 server can be found at [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/144/ISC-Bind.html?vendor_id=64). In addition, SecurityTrails provides a short [list](https://securitytrails.com/blog/most-popular-types-dns-attacks) of the most popular attacks on DNS servers.

Some of the settings we can see below lead to these vulnerabilities, among others. Because DNS can get very complicated and it is very easy for errors to creep into this service, forcing an administrator to work around the problem until they find an exact solution. This often leads to elements being released so that parts of the infrastructure function as planned and desired. In such cases, functionality has a higher priority than security, which leads to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

Sometimes it is also possible to query a DNS server's version using a class CHAOS query and type TXT. However, this entry must exist on the DNS server. For this, we could use the following command:

#### DIG - Version Query

  DNS

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.85

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> CH TXT version.bind
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:

;; WHEN: Wed Jan 05 20:23:14 UTC 2023
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 101
```

We can use the option `ANY` to view all available records. This will cause the server to show us all available entries that it is willing to disclose. It is important to note that not all entries from the zones will be shown.

#### DIG - ANY Query

  DNS

```shell-session

If the administrator used a subnet for the `allow-transfer` option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to `any`, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server. In addition, other zones can be queried, which may even show internal IP addresses and hostnames.

The individual `A` records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt).

An option would be to execute a `for-loop` in Bash that lists these entries and sends the corresponding query to the desired DNS server.

#### Subdomain Brute Forcing

  DNS

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done

ns.inlanefreight.htb.   604800  IN      A       10.129.34.136
mail1.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN      A       10.129.18.201
app.inlanefreight.htb.  604800  IN      A       10.129.18.15
```

Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way. One of these tools is, for example [DNSenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum).
