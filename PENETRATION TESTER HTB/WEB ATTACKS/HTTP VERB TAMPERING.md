## HTTP Verb Tampering

To understand `HTTP Verb Tampering`, we must first learn about the different methods accepted by the HTTP protocol. HTTP has [9 different verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) that can be accepted as HTTP methods by web servers. Other than `GET` and `POST`, the following are some of the commonly used HTTP verbs:

|Verb|Description|
|---|---|
|`HEAD`|Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the `headers`, without the response body|
|`PUT`|Writes the request payload to the specified location|
|`DELETE`|Deletes the resource at the specified location|
|`OPTIONS`|Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs|
|`PATCH`|Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location|
