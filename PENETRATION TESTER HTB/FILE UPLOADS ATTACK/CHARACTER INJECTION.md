## Character Injection

Finally, let's discuss another method of bypassing a whitelist validation test through `Character Injection`. We can inject several characters before or after the final extension to cause the web application to misinterpret the filename and execute the uploaded file as a PHP script.

The following are some of the characters we may try injecting:

- `%20`
- `%0a`
- `%00`
- `%0d0a`
- `/`
- `.\`
- `.`
- `…`
- `:`
Each character has a specific use case that may trick the web application to misinterpret the file extension. For example, (`shell.php%00.jpg`) works with PHP servers with version `5.X` or earlier, as it causes the PHP web server to end the file name after the (`%00`), and store it as (`shell.php`), while still passing the whitelist. The same may be used with web applications hosted on a Windows server by injecting a colon (`:`) before the allowed file extension (e.g. `shell.aspx:.jpg`), which should also write the file as (`shell.aspx`). Similarly, each of the other characters has a use case that may allow us to upload a PHP script while bypassing the type validation test.

We can write a small bash script that generates all permutations of the file name, where the above characters would be injected before and after both the `PHP` and `JPG` extensions, as follows:
