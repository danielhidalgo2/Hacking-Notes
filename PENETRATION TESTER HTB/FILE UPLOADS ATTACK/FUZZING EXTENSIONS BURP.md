## Fuzzing Extensions

As the web application seems to be testing the file extension, our first step is to fuzz the upload functionality with a list of potential extensions and see which of them return the previous error message. Any upload requests that do not return an error message, return a different message, or succeed in uploading the file, may indicate an allowed file extension.

There are many lists of extensions we can utilize in our fuzzing scan. `PayloadsAllTheThings` provides lists of extensions for [PHP](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst) and [.NET](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20ASP) web applications. We may also use `SecLists` list of common [Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt).

We may use any of the above lists for our fuzzing scan. As we are testing a PHP application, we will download and use the above [PHP](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst) list. Then, from `Burp History`, we can locate our last request to `/upload.php`, right-click on it, and select `Send to Intruder`. From the `Positions` tab, we can `Clear` any automatically set positions, and then select the `.php` extension in `filename="HTB.php"` and click the `Add` button to add it as a fuzzing position:

We'll keep the file content for this attack, as we are only interested in fuzzing file extensions. Finally, we can `Load` the PHP extensions list from above in the `Payloads` tab under `Payload Options`. We will also un-tick the `URL Encoding` option to avoid encoding the (`.`) before the file extension. Once this is done, we can click on `Start Attack` to start fuzzing for file extensions that are not blacklisted:

We can sort the results by `Length`, and we will see that all requests with the Content-Length (`193`) passed the extension validation, as they all responded with `File successfully uploaded`. In contrast, the rest responded with an error message saying `Extension not allowed`.
