# Lab: Excessive trust in client-side controls


1. With Burp running, log in and attempt to buy the leather jacket. The order is rejected because you don't have enough store credit.
2. In Burp, go to "Proxy" > "HTTP history" and study the order process. Notice that when you add an item to your cart, the corresponding request contains a `price` parameter. Send the `POST /cart` request to Burp Repeater.
3. In Burp Repeater, change the price to an arbitrary integer and send the request. Refresh the cart and confirm that the price has changed based on your input.
4. Repeat this process to set the price to any amount less than your available store credit.
5. Complete the order to solve the lab.
